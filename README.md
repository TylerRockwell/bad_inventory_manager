#Shop-Keepers Inventory Manager
A man runs an item shop where he sells mighty weapons, armor, and cures for legendary traveling heroes. Tired with his pen-and-paper inventory management system, he called Lyralei (a Rails developer) and requested that she build an inventory management system for his shop. She only had a small amount of time but she got the job done.

The program had some very simple requirements.

1. A user can create categories for items of inventory.
2. A user can create items of inventory under existing categories.
3. Items of inventory have a price, quantity, stock code, and expiration date.
4. When you pass an item's expiration date, it is not displayed in the inventory index page
5. A user can delete an item from the inventory.
8. A user can search for items in the inventory.
